1,34594,"edit: i got an ama thread now. help me: URL tifu didn t happen today but quite a few years back. for obvious reasons i m using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. -------------------------anyway, around 8 years back i lived in northern mozambique, a coastal southern african country with quite a warm climate. my mother at the time was going through a health nut phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. one of these was coconuts. she would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.anyway, being a horny teenager i fapped in regular intervals. unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and i was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. one day i hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. honestly to this day i can t fathom why i thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. i end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of concerted effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. i decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing some butter before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. i fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so i blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. --------------------for the next week the coconut is my saviour. whenever i want to get off i simply take it out and fuck it in its delightfully tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. it s heaven. now before i continue i d best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn t really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would go away in the winter . about a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck i had been using it pretty much every day since then i begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. must be the coconut right? so i decide that i ll fuck it once more before i throw it out and get a new one. worst mistake i have ever made. you see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. as i penetrate the coconut one last time i begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. puzzled, i pull my cock out to discover that it is covered in rotted and moldy butter and semen and teeming with tiny fucking maggots . they were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. i screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck i was doing with my life. never again. never again. edit: jesus this exploded. i m glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because i sure cry everytime i think back to it.edit 2: rip inboxedit 3: thanks for the gold. it eases my shame a little. i m thinking of doing an ama for you more curious individuals. maybe if the post hits 10k - it s quite uncomfortable to discuss though as the visceral memories come backedit 4: my shame has never been this large. 47.1k upvotes. my story of coconut fucking is now permanently etched into reddit s history. lord save me.

2,37412,"recently, i traveled to denver, colorado with my wife and my wife s parents. as a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing i was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed. what could possibly go wrong?so the first thing i do upon arriving and after successfully ditching the in-laws is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree. and oh my god, it was just like in my dreams. tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains: are you looking for a mellow body high? or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy? or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off? yes, yes and yes! i reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options. in hindsight, if i learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like what is an ounce? or how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend? sure, i can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite avogadro s number, but it turns out that none of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.and it was at this dispensary that i also learned that you can t actually smoke in public places including the hotel that my wife and i were staying at . as a result, before leaving, i begged my wife to buy some edibles that i could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit. after expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the imperial measurement system she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.when we finally get back to the hotel room, i tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter. what the fuck, denver? seeing the skepticism and hunger in my eyes, my wife warns me that i should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one. dose size: 1 2 cookie, i read silently as i start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed. but what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie? so a second later, i covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. and then i quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back. we may not have legal weed back home, but i routinely devour an entire package of milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat. your move, tiny gingersnaps. about 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents rental car on the way to dinner. and that s when things start to go tits-up. my stomach growls. loudly and angrily. my wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say diarrhea? but i merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness. you didn t eat a whole cookie, did you? she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation. of course not. i respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.a few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant. i don t remember how i made it to my seat, and i don t remember even looking at the menu, but i do remember the concerned look on the waiter s face as he asked me if i was doing alright. keep it together, man, i say to myself. but my wife s sudden groan suggests that i may have also said that to the waiter. things are going downhill fast.the waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. the moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me. i start to worry that the jig is up. you are sweating... from your entire face, she says with both pity and disgust. not quite knowing what to do, i reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead. at this point, my wife s mom looks over at me with some concern. are you alright? she asks kindly. yeah, the food s just a bit spicy, i reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is nothing on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls. my wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. athroom. now. she hisses. get it together. i reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet. after splashing several handfuls of water on my face, i approach a urinal and start to pee. now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality. as i am peeing, i start to get the very unsettling feeling that i have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.but deep down i know that is absurd: i ve been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day. i ve probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most. so given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like i am about half way done -- that means that i ve probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?but the guy at the urinal next to me doesn t respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin. i try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. after finally finishing, i again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table for being gone such a long time just in case my math was off. next, i try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife s father, but i am far too high to understand what either of us are saying. not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment -- or, really, at any moment -- i figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water. nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right? to my wife s horror, i stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant. but he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he ll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal. he also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren t too spicy for me, i should probably eat one or two so that i m not sitting there on an empty stomach.smart man. however, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, i start to get worried that i need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils. do you think i should flag down the waiter again and ask what s taking so long? i suggest helpfully to my wife. what?! we literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago. and at that exchange, my wife loses her cool. how many cookies did you eat?! she demands. whoa, easy there, torquemada, i respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst. i had a few cookies, but keep it down. i don t want your parents to know how fucked up i am right now. really?! they are sitting two feet away from you. they know. i look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity. edit: wow! thanks everyone for all the love and for even some of the hate ! i think i have officially peaked in life.as for part ii of the story, there s a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short. at that point, my wife s singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before i either puked all over the table or pissed myself or an unsightly combination of both . so after a few spastic, two-handed waves good-bye to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a secret service agent evacuating the president. my night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at getting handsie back in the hotel room. but being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: please don t die, we have a mortgage.

3,37333,"this happened sunday night.my oldest son is in the marines, hasnt been home in almost a year. he took 10 days leave so he could come visit. at first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. when it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her. i tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers falcons game, as a cover to pick him up. i get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane. he gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his dress blues. now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.we discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house. we go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house. we settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... free internet points and all that......i walk in and the house is quiet. no one in the living room. a little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed? alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......what i did not know was the entire time i was gone, my wife set in motion her own plan for the evening. she got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime. took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her fuck me lingerie.so no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to surprise her. a handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable. pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one. the text told my son to stay outside. i had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else. so my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life. i told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see. the look of confusion on her face was priceless. it took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door. finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, there was our son in his dress uniform and she was estatic. the noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy. except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed. it goes without saying i did not get any action that night. also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points. so i guess tifu will have to suffice instead. edit 1: goldx2? wow thank you guys. this one post has more upvotes than my 4 year old main account.update: wife is freaking out that i put this on reddit. have been reading some of the comments to her this morning. she is worried that this story will end up in one of her marine moms fb groups and they somehow will magically know it was her lol. son wants to take his siblings out for ice cream and the new lego movie, cross your fingers people.

ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. so as part of my degree i have to take microeconomics which all i knew about it previously was it s about the economy and money. when i get to class they re talking about supply and demand curves shifting so i just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.this goes on for 3.5 weeks. i came to class. took notes. then did the weekly assignments. on the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is febuary 1st. so the class before the exam, january 30th, i decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. now i was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was all theory based while the class was heavy math based. i understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. i explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this: explains above about material prof: what do you mean theory? all the assignments are filled with math. are you using launchpad? me: no the assignments are online. like the website we bought the textbook from. whats lauchpad? prof: pardon? i don t have a textbook for this course. me: it literally says in the syllabus, look! shows syllabus prof: wait, what class are you supposed to be in? me: what do you mean...? this is econ 202 right? prof starts laughing prof: haha this is econ 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. this is a new one, i ve never experienced this before. me: well this is awkward. i better go see my actual teacher and explain. i then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. i caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. even showed him my econ 301 notes to prove i couldn t make this shit up. he just laughed and said the same thing this is a new one for me. turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. same with the midterms. they were relevant because it was obviously a level above what i was supposed to be doing and the only thing i got wrong was the building code. they were both classroom 112, just different buildings. so basically i just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. wish me luck tomorrow! edit: well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying you made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha . the exam is in a couple hours and i will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:1. ya, the trip wasn t the smartest but i had fun and went to tiesto s birthday in vegas amongst other kool stuff. life goes on.2. i was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and i had the actual textbook pirated, no one buys textbooks c mon . so i do have a grasp of whats going on.. kinda. he did everything on the board and there were online notes but i figured you did practical application in class and the online notes actually for my 202 class were for reference purposes. 3. i highly doubt i ll fail the course or the midterm. it s amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. i ve made it through almost 3 years of engineering so i m sure it will turn out fine. it ll be a funny story at grad when i get my ring.thanks for all the support too. : making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018 s been no sarcasm and this is just a minor set back.edit 2: just got back from the exam.. i didn t crush it but there

6,38348,"this happened a few years ago and i was living in zimbabwe at the time, and i was having a pretty bad day, i was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. if youre african you ll understnad that this was no small journey. so i got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.half an hour passes and we re making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so i do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he s throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him first mistake .i get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he s not.....then i here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so i wake up a couple hours later iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. so i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. i explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where i am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night which might be our thief . i start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so i pitch up and start waiting, now i know most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and i dont have the best memory so i didnt know any numbers that would come in handy . after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch i let him know the situaion and he says we re in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he s willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which i thought great!its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, i take down his number so i can repay him later on. at this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, i walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. im about 100 feet from the house and i see my son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. i get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like ive been gone for months. my auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.i still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and i see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....so it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what i had stumbled upon.my son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

7,28248,"as usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. i d like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident i was 29 years old. first, a little back story...sunday, april 2, 2017 started like any other sunday for me. i woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend s oil changed, as well as my own. i drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. i drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. i was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.as i watched the video i felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. having never had a migraine before, i assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. the pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though i was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. they finished the oil and as they did, i texted my girlfriend to let her know that i had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.i got back to her house, popped a couple ibuprofen mistake and took a nap. i woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. i decided i would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning i would be good to go to work.i woke up monday morning still feeling like shit and decided i was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. my girlfriend tried her best to convince me that i needed to go to the er but i told her i just needed more rest and would be fine. she reluctantly let me try to rest as much as i could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. the only relief i could find was taking pain killers, which i m not a big fan of, and napping.i woke up tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, enough is enough. against my protest, she dragged me to the er...and saved my life.i went in to the er and told them my symptoms, also telling them that i have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. they sent me to do a ct scan of my head, without the contrast because i wouldn t let them tap an iv on my arm. the ct scan was performed and i was brought back to the room to await the results. as i sat there i caught the dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. it was at this point i knew....something was fucked up! dave chappelle voice the dr. came flying into the room and said, hey listen man, you ve had a stroke and you ve got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. i need to tap an iv on you right now, do another ct scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to stanford asap! my life stopped. a stroke? i m 29? how could i have had a stroke? i couldn t comprehend what was happening but i looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. i got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. side note: i live in california but grew up in new jersey which is where all my family still resides i quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. i asked her to please call my dad and hung up.what happened next is a whirlwind. they tapped an iv, did a ct scan then i was transported by ambulance to stanford icu. i was greeted by the entire neurology department, both residents and students alike. the first woman i met said she, couldn t believe i was even still awake, let alone walking and talking. she told me, usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead. as i laid in icu they tapped an a-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more iv s for a total of 4 into my other arm. they had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and i wouldn t be capable of making decisions for myself. they were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.my parents flew in from jersey by the next day and i was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon wednesday . if you ve never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. i ve had 3. they lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are not asleep. they then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. let me repeat, you are awake for this!the first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. the blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn t see anything. i was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and i was allowed to leave the hospital by friday morning. i used up all my fmla leave 12 weeks and have been on disability since.but wait...there s more!!!6 weeks later i had to go back to stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. this time they found the culprit. i had what is known as an arterioveneous fistula burst inside my brain. it s when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. to my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head which i did not take or from a case of bad luck which sounds more my speed .6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke i went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. i was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the best neurosurgeons in the world. a 3rd angiogram was performed while i was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.i awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain i have ever been in. while i was asleep, two more iv s had been put into my arm, an a-line had been put in my wrist again, and i had a c-line, which is an iv in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. the fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. they could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.the surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me i would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. the next day after the surgery i realized that i had double vision so bad that i couldn t see with both my eyes open. it was either one or the other. i had to patch my eye until i could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. my surgery was on a wednesday and by friday i was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.fast forward, to october 2, 2017.my vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, i was finally ready to return to work. i was so excited my first day back, even though i wasn t in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. around 11:30 am i took my lunch and finished reading my book i had been reading. at 12:30 pm i returned to work and about 10 minutes later i decided i had to use the bathroom. i left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.i could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what i describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. i got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. i started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. i think i tried to call my fiance we got engaged after the stroke in april for help but i don t remember because i blacked out. next thing i remember was a foreman standing over me asking if i was alright and all i could think was, how d this guy get in my bedroom? i was delirious, i had smashed my face on the concrete when i fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. my supervisor took me to the er where they did ct scans, blood work, ekg and chest x-rays. my white cell count was through the roof but they couldn t find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy passing out .i did a follow up with my pcp primary care physician and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to stanford neurology to talk with them. and so i have...and this is where i am today...i was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. the issue, as i ve been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. due to the amount of time i allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.what this means for me now is i ll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. thank god the company i work for is so large that they can move me to another position where i won t be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment i feel. working construction has been my all time favorite. i m a blue collar guy and i get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. i ve poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. my days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is done. it sucks. i m not happy about it, but i don t let it change my outlook on life.i refuse to give up on life. i can get through anything and i will get through this. i m out of work until january 8, 2018 at which point i will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as i did before.i tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. please, i m begging you! if you ever feel like something is wrong with you...do not hesitate! go to the hospital! don t be like me, mr. toughguy, thinking you can get through it. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren t right.i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. may god bless your life and your health-zk edit: here are some pics of when i was in the hospital and the recovery of the incision.

october 2, 2017.my vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, i was finally ready to return to work. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.i could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what i describe as a floating bubble, that

talk with them. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.what this means for me now is i 'll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren 't right.i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story.","i was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.as i watched the video i felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. i decided i would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning i would be good to go to work.i woke up monday morning still feeling like shit and decided i was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. she reluctantly let me try to rest as much as i could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. the only relief i could find was taking pain killers, which i 'm not a big fan of, and napping.i woke up tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, enough is enough.   dave chappelle voice the dr. came flying into the room and said, hey listen man, you 've had a stroke and you 've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. the first woman i met said she, couldn 't believe i was even still awake, let alone walking and talking.  she told me, usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here either in a coma...or dead. to my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head which i did not take or from a case of bad luck which sounds more my speed .6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke i went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. they could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.the surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me i would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. the next day after the surgery i realized that i had double vision so bad that i couldn 't see with both my eyes open. my surgery was on a wednesday and by friday i was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.fast forward, to october 2, 2017.my vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, i was finally ready to return to work. i was so excited my first day back, even though i wasn 't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.i could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what i describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. i think i tried to call my fiance we got engaged after the stroke in april for help but i don 't remember because i blacked out. my white cell count was through the roof but they couldn 't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy passing out .i did a follow up with my pcp primary care physician and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to stanford neurology to talk with them. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.what this means for me now is i 'll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. thank god the company i work for is so large that they can move me to another position where i won 't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment i feel. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren 't right.i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story.","i 'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident i was 29 years old. i decided i would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning i would be good to go to work.i woke up monday morning still feeling like shit and decided i was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. they sent me to do a ct scan of my head, without the contrast because i wouldn 't let them tap an iv on my arm.  dave chappelle voice the dr. came flying into the room and said, hey listen man, you 've had a stroke and you 've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. i need to tap an iv on you right now, do another ct scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to stanford asap   a stroke  how could i have had a stroke  they were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.my parents flew in from jersey by the next day and i was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon wednesday . let me repeat, you are awake for this the first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain.  6 weeks later i had to go back to stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. they could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.the surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me i would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. i was so excited my first day back, even though i wasn 't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the

my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. i got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. my supervisor took me to the er where they did ct scans, blood work, ekg and chest x-rays. due to the amount of time i allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.what this means for me now is i 'll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren 't right.i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read

8,27694,"this happened only minutes ago.the graphics card in my old ps2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so i decided to replace it when i had a little extra cash. i was out browsing different sites like craigslist and the like, when i stumbled upon the ps2 mentioned in the title. it looked like a great deal at the time. 25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around 45 to 60.at the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.now, i should preface this by saying that i have a strange faith in the honesty of others. benefit of the doubt and all that noise. after all, the car i drive now is one i bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. why should this be any different?starting to sound like a mistake yet?if the answer is no, then have no fear. that is almost certainly about to change. the model the seller advertised on letgo was one of the larger black brick models. like, the first generation ones. when i finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. when he showed me the goods, it was actually one of the slim and silver ps2 s from later in the console s production run. he told me he had already sold the larger one.my first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that i should have walked away when i saw i was being sold something that was improperly advertised. unfortunately for me and i guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this , i was not in the most logical mood. it was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. i just wanted to get this thing and go home.back at the ole ranch, i hooked up the console, slapped in kingdom hearts ii, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. i m off work and done with class, what else would i do with my evening, right? i was pretty happy with my life until i realized i had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn t reading. strange, but not altogether discouraging. i slapped in another game that i new for sure was working. didn t read. i repeated this several times with discs i knew would work; same story.now i m starting to get slightly pissed. i m sure you can see where this next part is going.i open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. i ve now got no way to contact him. of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. all i could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. that, or i could get onto youtube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. i picked the latter option and went on my merry way. after a video about a quick mod i could make to the system, i was feeling pretty confident that i was going to get the last laugh on this one.oh golly gee fuck was i wrong.now at this point, i begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. i manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. it s putting up a little more of a fight than i saw in the videos, but why wouldn t it? it was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. with a little elbow grease, it starts to give. i m also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. a bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so i can live with that. the further i get it open, the more rust i see on some more critical pieces. i m sweating again, but holding out hope. finally, the plastic casing comes free, and i experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.i experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.you see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. the first thing i notice is that the inside is covered in rust. the second thing i notice is that some of the rust is moving.oh, that s not all rust. ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches. do you know that scene in raiders of the lost ark where indiana jones is like, snakes. why did it have to be snakes? that was me. except with cockroaches. they are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. and now they re crawling on my hands. and these are the quick little tiny ones that don t give two fucks about whether you ve stepped on them or not. i threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.they re getting everywhere now. i m yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. you would think that something caught fire with the way i was yelling which is what my roommate said he thought had happened , but no, just cockroaches. tiny, 25 freaks of nature. eventually i managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point i grabbed a can of raid from the laundry room and finished the job.at least, i hope i finished the job. i m fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point i m a little too emotionally drained to care. i also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that i basically just paid 25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. jesus, it s only 3 in the afternoon and i already need a stiff drink. edit: hi, reddit! i just wanted to say many thanks for the gold and all the offers for cockroach-free playstations! warms my heart, and i m super happy you guys enjoyed my writing as well. happy redditing!

23,53,"throwaway account for obvious reasons. as i type this i feel a little smile creep over my face. i guessed i ve finally gotten over it. it s a long read but worth it...maybe.let s set the scene: i was a 14 year old boy now early twenties and like lots of boys that age, i was no stranger to my erect penis. it d pop up at me seemingly every other minute of every day. oftentimes i d greet it with a not-so-formal handshake behind closed doors. other times i d be good and ignore it. you get the drift. i was at peace with my piece.so, to the day it happened. i used to play a lot of football soccer to non brits and one day i came home from a vigorous training session and just really needed to shower. i got in the house, called out to my mum that i was home and ran straight upstairs to wash.i got in the bathroom, flung my clothes all over the floor and had a shower. easy. on getting out of the shower, i realised that my peen had straightened out significantly and was eager to nuisance me. yet again, i had an erection. i chose to ignore it and began drying off, hoping it would hang back down. after i had finished drying off, wangy mcjohnson was still erect and for a second i was a little annoyed; he just would not leave me alone. however, in this moment of annoyance also came a moment of teenage ingenuity. i saw my clothes and towel on the floor and in that moment, figured that i could, well...test the strength of my peen.it started off quite simple. grabbed a t-shirt, balanced it on there. added the shorts. added the socks. that was too easy, so still laughing to myself i thought i would do willy pull-ups with the towel. it was a big heavy towel, so i folded it in half and balanced it on there. i started clenching my member and wahey! there we go. my penis was lifting weights and i couldn t be happier. 14 y o me didn t need much to have a good time.from here i figured i could make a game of this, so i opened up the bathroom door and also my bedroom door. house logistics: when you open the bathroom door, you are on the hallway. 90 degrees right, and you have the opening to my bedroom and the consequent end of the hallway. straight ahead was my siblings bedroom, 90 degrees left and you have the top of the staircase. 180 degrees and you re facing back in the bathroom.only my mum was home, and she had no reason to come upstairs so i was in the clear.absolutely bollock naked and with a penis medusa could have been staring at, i made a game of it.i balanced the t-shirt on the end of my shlong, began some steadying, gentle hip swings, and once i got enough momentum... fling! i swung the t-shirt from where i was stood outside the bathroom and into my bedroom. this was only a few metres away at most but hey, it was hilariously satisfying. the shorts followed. fling! sock number one. fling! sock number two. fling! towel. flengh! flengh because it took a few attempts and just sort of dropped due to the weight and size i felt quite proud of myself. then i saw my football soccer boots just sitting there. they had seen what i was doing. they had seen what i was doing, and i can only imagine what they must have been thinking. nevertheless, like a great viking warrior i picked up boot number one, and did the same. the shape of the boot made it quite difficult to balance though and it took a while before i got the knack. eventually, after much balancing and semi-squatting, i mastered it and all was great.so, boot number two.now what i haven t mentioned is that the staircase 90 degrees to my left was like a broken u shape, so if you were on the upstairs hallway you wouldn t know someone was coming up the stairs until they were at the final four steps, and directly facing you. of course if you were listening even the tiniest bit you would hear someone, but if you were concentrating really, really hard on balancing a football boot on your dick you wouldn t. you wouldn t hear a thing. especially as no one ever really came upstairs only siblings, who were away for a few weeks .so, it happened. in full concentration, in full nudity, in full glory; there i was stood, hands on hips, back arched, boot on boner when my mum came up the stairs. she looked straight at me. she was four steps away. that s like 2 metre s from where i stood. her eye level would have been at my third eye level.i have no idea why my mum came upstairs. i have no idea why i was flinging football boots off my throbber. we never spoke about it and still haven t to this day. she turned around instantly with a gasp and headed back downstairs.i locked myself in my room and we avoided each other for as long as possible.i just hope she forgot. ...i still don t know why.

24,74,"so i ll start this off by explaining to you that i am a 16 year old male in my junior year of high school. now i ve never been good in english, this year especially. it s not that i can t do it or don t understand it, it s just that i get extremely sleepy and sometimes fall asleep. i can t help it, it just happens, i can write the essays, i can do the busy work, but i will almost always fall asleep. so because of this i have begun to find reason to stand up, move around or take a break from class in order to wake myself up. last friday i chose to go to the restroom. story time i had just awoken from an unpleasant, uncomfortable desk nap and i realized i definitely needed to go wake myself up with some water from the fountain and i could use the restroom. so i walk up and i ask my teacher if i can go to the bathroom and she says the classic bitchy old lady i don t know can you shit and my sleepy self just looked at her blankly and stared. she then realized i needed a break so she let me go. as i was walking towards the restroom i felt myself waking up a little bit and decided to take a drink or water, mmm great, so then i went into the restroom mind you i just woke up about a minute ago . so there i was in the restroom, and there were a few guys in the corner smoking an e-cig and i said yo guys why re you all in there and they responded with oh hey dude we are uhm, smoking smarties and they all laughed, me, being the tired dumb ass i was, believed them and then i made a joke about smoking pixie sticks. they laughed and went back to smoking their now i realize e-cig and i went to the urinal. this is where it happens, i begin to pee........... it starts off normally with the pee flowing down into the urinal from my dick, but then my tired mind wondered what it looked like to pee, like how it came out of my dick. so i just pointed my dick up at wide eyed face and pissed all over myself, after getting it in my mouth, eyes, and hair, i begin to scream and cuss. that s when the smokers looked over and saw my dumb ass peeing all over myself, they fucking lose it. they are on the floor dying of laughter because i just kept fucking going. a normal person would have shut all systems down or let go of their dick or something but nope not me i just kept screaming, slurping, blinking, crying, you know, everything one would do in that situation. so after my anaconda calmed down and stopped hissing i stood there and tried to wake up from the nightmare i was in, but believe you me, i was damn awake now. the smokers kept laughing and then i looked at them and began to move towards them to ask for maybe a spare hoodie or anything i still don t know, but that made them bolt and get the hell out of there. so i got in the stall and sat there with piss all over my face, hair, and some on my jacket for like a good 15 minutes wondering what to do next. i decided to just stick my head in the sink and threw away my jacket, eventually i was semi clean but smelled like shit. i then went to the nurse and got a home pass and went back to class and got my stuff and left. those three guys who saw me though are well known in my school and could tell one person and have the whole school know. so far there s been nothing about it mentioned to me but it is the weekend so i m preparing for hell tomorrow... wish me luck reddit, wish me luck... edit 1- split paragraphsupdate 1- currently in second hour, nobody has said anything but i swear people are giving me the eyes. i think i m going insane...
